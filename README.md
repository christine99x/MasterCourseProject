## Introduction to Deep Learning (IDL)
There are four assignments in this section, and all of them were done with Yuan Lin. 
## Social Network Analysis for Computer Scientists (SNACS)
There are two personal assignments and a course project in this section. The course project was completed with Yuan Lin.
## Advances in Data Mining (AiDM)
There are three assignments in this section, and all of them were done with Yuan Lin.
## Text Mining (TM)
The course project was done with Yuan Lin.
## Evolutionary Algorithm (EA)
In this project, we searched for the solution by Genetic Algorithm (GA) and Evolutionary Strategy (ES). The project was done in a group of two, and ES, listed here, was done by me.
## Audio Processing and Indexing (API)
The aim of this project is to transform a small piece of classical music with the piano into jazz music with the piano, guitar, drums, and saxophone. We used some generate models, and merged the results. See more details on [this](https://github.com/hwqddddd/API_final_project.git) page.
